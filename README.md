# infix-parser

A data structure and algorithm exercise. It converts an infix expression to prefix.

This is a solution to the first problem in
http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/InfixPrefixandPostfixExpressions.html

The difference between this Clojure solution and the Python solution is that the Clojure solution parses an infix expression to create an intermediate tree data structure which can be used to produce both prefix or postfix expressions, wherease the Python solution is a direct conversion.
